# Elm Gulp Starter Project

Its basically a template development environment with my favorite tooling and what I believe to be the best practices. Its the repo I pull down when I start new Elm projects. It also might be useful to look at, if you are learning how to use Elm.

How to get going..
```
git clone git@github.com:Chadtech/gulp-elm-starter-project.git new-project
cd new-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
then open up http://localhost:6888
